        <p>This topic contains a drop-down example</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Denmark has a developed mixed economy that is classed as a high-income economy by the World Bank.[102] It ranks 18th in the world in terms of GDP (PPP) per capita and 6th in nominal GDP per capita.[103][104] Denmark's economy stands out as one of the most free in the Index of Economic Freedom and the Economic Freedom of the World.[105][106] It is the 13th most competitive economy in the world, and 8th in Europe, according to the World Economic Forum in its Global Competitiveness Report 2014–2015.

        <p>Denmark has the fourth highest ratio of tertiary degree holders in the world.[108] The country ranks highest in the world for workers' rights.[109] GDP per hour worked was the 13th highest in 2009. The country has a market income inequality close to the OECD average,[110][111] but after public cash transfers the income inequality is very low. According to the International Monetary Fund, Denmark has the world's highest minimum wage.[112] As Denmark has no minimum wage legislation, the high wage floor has been attributed to the power of trade unions. For example, as the result of a collective bargaining agreement between the 3F trade union and the employers group Horesta, workers at McDonald's and other fast food chains make the equivalent of US$20 an hour, which is more than double what their counterparts earn in the United States, and have access to five weeks' paid vacation, parental leave and a pension plan.</p>
        <p>Denmark's currency, the krone (DKK), is pegged at approximately 7.46 kroner per euro through the ERM. Although a September 2000 referendum rejected adopting the euro,[120] the country follows the policies set forth in the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union and meets the economic convergence criteria needed to adopt the euro. The majority of the political parties in the Folketing support adopting the euro, but as yet a new referendum has not been held, despite plans;[121] scepticism of the EU among Danish voters has historically been strong.</p>
        <p>Denmark is home to many multinational companies, among them: A.P. Møller-Mærsk, (international shipping), Arla Foods (dairy), Lego Group (toys), Danfoss (industrial services), Carlsberg Group (beer), Vestas (wind turbines), and the pharmaceutical companies Leo Pharma and Novo Nordisk.</p>
