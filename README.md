Venture outside of the CSS comfortzone
===
I've hosted a workshop on manipulating the stylesheet of a MadCap Flare project using an external editor a the MadUsers 2016 conference organised by [Write2Users](http://write2users.com/madusers-conference-2016/). If you are planning to attend the workshop I hope you will enjoy it and find it inspiring. 


# What is this repo about?
To succesfully participate in the workshop you will need an example Flare project. The example project can be downloaded from this repo two weeks before the start of the conference. After the conference you can also download the slidedeck and other references. 

# How can you help?
I would like this workshop to provide as much value to you as possible. I believe that your involvement will increase that value exponentially. This is how you can help:

* Explore the materials offered and write up issues
* Join us on [Slack]{https://madusers.slack.com) and introduce yourself, please ask general questions here and get in touch with your fellow workshop participants.
